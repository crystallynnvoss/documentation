# Citation Format

## Introduction

SPEC's documentation site utilizes a simple citation format to encourage contributors to always cite their sources. SPEC citation format leverages Gitbook's functionality.

## Online Article or Blog Post&#x20;

When the author name and publication date are known simply include the author's name, the title of the article configured as a link to page's URL, and the publication day (allowing for year only when exact date is unknown).
