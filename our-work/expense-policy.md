# Expense Policy

## Introduction

This document is intended to provide guidance to individuals working as contractors with Sustainable Progress and Equality Collective \(SPEC\) on the proper and timely submission of billable expenses. All billable time must be approved by one of SPEC's Collective Administrators before starting work and tracking expenses. Expenses submitted for work that was not explicitly approved by a Collective Administrator will be rejected.

SPEC reserves the right to reject any expenses submitted with insufficient information or that do not correspond to the pre-agreed on scope of work, time commitment, and pay rate. SPEC pays out expenses on a weekly basis. Expensed should be submitted by Wednesday at 8 PM Eastern Time each week. Contributors who submit their expenses after this deadline may receive their pay the following week.

## Submitting Expenses

Expenses should be submitted via the "Submit Expense" feature within [SPECâ€™s Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/spec) page. Before submitting hours for payment, please ensure you have:

* Tracked only billable expenses
* Confirmed tracked expenses with your Project Lead
* Accounted for each hour for which you are billing
* Remembered that only expenses with a Toggl Track invoice and timesheet will be approved
