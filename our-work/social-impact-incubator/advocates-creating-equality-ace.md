### Mission

ACE is dedicated to educating youth on culture and diversity while seeking solutions to social issues associated with racism. Fighting for a fair and just world creates opportunities for people of color to have a brighter, more equitable future.

### Vision

We seek to build the courage in young people to become change agents in our society. ACE will use equity pedagogy as a teaching strategy to inspire those we work with to obtain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to transform their communities. We will create opportunities for young people to learn and grow as self-advocates while they work to bridge gaps in social equality.

### Core Values

**Celebrate: **The knowledge, creativity, and identities of our members and partners.

**Recognize: **That with clarity, learning, and growth we can have an impact on normalizing cultural competency.

**Embrace: **The challenges and oppositions in creating racial equity.

### Executive Director & Board

#### Asia Moore, Executive Director

Asia Moore is in her final year of graduate school at SUNY Empire State College where she is studying Social and Public Policy. Her research focuses on youth advocacy, education, race, and socioeconomic disparities. As a professional, her work has focused on the disparities associated with young people coping with poverty and connecting them to resources and/or providing them with supports to overcome any challenges that may prevent them from thriving in society. Asia has collaborated with SUNY Orange and the Liberty Partnership Program to host a youth summit encouraging leadership as well as a resource fair for students in the City of Newburgh School District to have access to free community resources.

She is a third term Research Associate (RA) with Sustainable Progress and Equality Collective (SPEC) working specifically on projects focused on cultural competency, advocacy, and civic engagement with youth. Currently, Asia is dedicating her time to ACE as a part of SPEC's Social Impact Incubator program, partnering with local community-based organizations and public schools to help children become change agents in their communities.

Some of Asia's other passions are providing assistance to youth in residential treatment centers, juvenile systems, and foster care.
