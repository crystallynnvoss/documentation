The Journal of Engaged Research (JoER) is the official publication of SPEC. JoER was created to take an activist approach to address the many challenges brought about by the twin crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current period of social unrest. It creates a space for diverse individuals who may not have access to traditional academic publishing channels. The first issue of the journal was published in May 2021 and is currently hosted on [Medium](https://medium.com/journal-of-engaged-research). We encourage learners and emerging scholars alike to submit their work for publication. JoER gives voice to those who take action, no matter one's formal training or background. We are excited to include learner voices in this endeavor. Unlike traditional journals, the editorial staff at JoER takes an interactive approach, providing mentorship and guidance to help contributors with publication. All papers are reviewed by appropriate topic scholars or professionals in related fields.
