# Operating Principles

## Introduction

> #### "Organizations, companies or individuals without core values are exactly like a boat without an anchor; it can be easy tossed to and fro following any direction the wind blows."

> Dr. Lucas D. Shallua

The Sustainable Progress and Equality Collective was founded when two like-minded individuals, with a shared mission of making the world a better place, connected and spontaneously decided to cooperate to respond to the challenges facing their communities. SPEC's founders established the collective based on the core values of sustainability, progress, and equality. They chose these core values, because combined they provide a recipe for building radically transparent and equitable organizations. SPEC's operating principles operationalize the core values, providing a framework for decision-making and organizational development. 

## Core Values

### Equality

Most people would agree that we all want a more equal world where every person can live a full, peaceful, happy life. However, systemic and institutional racism, sexism, gender bias, and other forms of discrimination and prejudice still persist in society. Discrimination and prejudice, fueled by greed, fear, and confusion, are a huge obstacle to giving everyone an equal chance at living happy and productive lives. To address discrimination and oppression we will need to treat each other with mutual respect and accountability; and give voice to those are oppressed and underserved. To overcome these challenges, we will need to continuously take collective action and share knowledge to innovate and create lasting solutions.

### Progress

Transformative change can be achieved through collective action, research, and critical reflection. We can collaborate openly, sharing our research, knowledge, and resources, to accelerate sustainability and social impact initiatives. However, sustaining progress is a challenge, with many forces impeding on advancement of humanitarian and environmental causes. Progress that leads to lasting change takes time, resources, and capital.

### Sustainability

In order for progress to deemed successful it will need produce sustainable systems of living and working, without disadvantaging anyone or causing offense to the environment. Our projects cannot take forever to complete, become prohibitively expensive, and must be financially sustainable. Our solutions, tools, and processes must efficiently use resources and energy. Above all else our actions must not hurt other people or the environment. Thus, environmental, technological, and financial sustainability is essential to making progress toward lasting change. Sustainable progress means we can maintain continuous collective action toward equality and environmental justice.

## Operating Principles

SPEC's operating principles are intended to expand our shared interpretation and understanding of the core values, inform decision-making, and serve as a framework for organizational development. SPEC is dedicated to building a radically transparent and equitable organization, and helping others do the same. To do so the organization will need continuously change how it operates and evolve over time. It will incorporate the voices and knowledge of our growing network along the way. Likewise our operating principles we be regularly revisited and updated to reflect SPEC's organizational goals, feedback, and contributions from our community.

Each core principle statement starts with a core value followed by the method through which we will achieve the intent of the value. The statements are designed to encapsulate the most fundamental principle employed to serve the core values.

1. **Sustainability Through Critical Systems Thinking**
2. **Progress Through Open Collaborative Action Research**
3. **Equality Through Mutual Reciprocity**

The core principles are based an a pluralism of research methodologies that span academic disciplines and problem domains. Each principle is described in detail in the following section.

### Sustainability Through Critical Systems Thinking

1. Use critical thinking and awareness when building systems; rigorously examining assumptions and evaluating the conditions which give rise to them.
2. Seek emancipatory solutions that define improvement locally and temporarily, create balance between economy, equity, and the environment, and account for issues of power
3. Systematically use a pluralism of research methodologies and technologies, becoming aware of their strengths and weaknesses, to synergistically solve complex problems.

### **Progress Through Open Collaborative Action Research**

1. Strive for openness in our research, communications, organizational process, and finances.
2. Seek to understand the world by trying to create transformative change in it, through collaboration, research, and critical reflection.
3. Create a work environment that provides brave spaces and psychological safety to enable full and fair participation of individuals from all social identity groups in a society.

### Equality Through Mutual Reciprocity

1. Treat all people, partners, participants, and everyone else in our communities with mutual respect and accountability.
2. Equality is the end goal; diversity, equity, and inclusion are the means to get there.
3. Prioritize physical and mental health, family, and happiness before work, career growth, and achievement.

## Theoretical Foundations

#### Complex Adaptive Systems

Sustainability is an incredibly complex issue. The Earth's climate, atmosphere, land, ocean, and biosphere, along with human civilization are complex adaptive systems \(CAS\). A CAS is simply a system in which many independent elements or agents interact, leading to emergent outcomes that are often difficult \(or impossible\) to predict simply by looking at the individual interactions. A CAS has three defining characteristics.\[1\]

1. The system consists of a number of heterogeneous agents, and each of those agents makes decisions about how to behave, with their decisions will evolving over time.
2. The agents in the system interact with one another.
3. Interactions between agents leads to emergence, where the whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts. The key issue is that you can’t really understand the whole system by simply looking at its individual parts.

People seek to improve complex adaptive systems, sometimes with disastrous consequences. One choice can lead to a series of cascading events that were completely unanticipated. People really have the best of intentions. But there is no way they can anticipate the ultimate results. Humans are incredibly good at linking cause and effect - sometimes too good.\[1\]

#### Challenges to Systemic Interventions

Ten thousand years ago most cause and effect was pretty clear. And our brains evolved to deal with that. However, that means that when you see something occur in a complex adaptive system, your mind is going to create a narrative to explain what happened—even though cause and effect are not comprehensible in that kind of system. Hindsight’s a beautiful thing. Also, we have a tendency to think that certain causes will lead to particular effects. We just don’t know. Our uncertainly is our biggest single bias.\[1\]

Faced with uncertainty, we tend to listen to authoritative figures, even when it’s been well documented that their predictions are quite poor. But they’re authoritative, so we listen to them, even when we know that these people are predicting something that’s fundamentally hard to predict. The individual who comes across as more authoritative is actually more believable. People are much more comfortable deferring to the person in the pinstripe suit with the PowerPoint slides.\[1\]

We’re also reluctant to share private information, so we aggregate information poorly. Because we choose to talk about shared information and reserve unique information, we can end up making bad decisions. Committees are not optimized to share private information. So even in organizations where the information exists, it’s not being surfaced.\[1\]

#### The Importance of Cognitive Diversity

How people think, their training, their experience, their personalities is key to tackling complex problems. Research has shown that diverse groups are better at making predictions and solving problems. Intentionally putting together different points of view that will challenge one another is essential for hiring and for building teams.\[1\]

Even if you have a diverse team, if you’re bowling everybody over with your point of view, that’s not going to be of great value. Leaders have to step back and let those diverse views surface. This doesn’t come naturally to leaders. Often we try to hire smart people. We try to put smart people on teams. But we don’t think enough about how much diversity can contribute. The key is to find smart people who think differently.\[1\] 

#### Critical Systems Thinking

Critical Systems Thinking \(CST\) is an approach to systemic intervention that combines systems thinking and participatory methods to address the challenges of problems characterized by large scale, complexity, uncertainty, impermanence, and imperfection. It was developed to account for nonlinear relationships, feedback loops, hierarchies, and emergent properties. CST has particularly problematized the issue of boundaries and their consequences for inclusion, exclusion and marginalization. As a research perspective CST is said to embrace three fundamental commitments.

1. Use critical awareness when examining and re-examining taken-for-granted assumptions, along with the conditions which give rise to them.
2. Focus on emancipation to ensure that "improvement" is defined temporarily and locally, taking issues of power \(which may affect the definition\) into account.
3. Apply methodological pluralism, using a variety of research methods in a theoretically coherent manner, becoming aware of their strengths and weaknesses, to address a corresponding variety of issues.

The idea that there are three commitments in CST was introduced into the literature by Flood and Jackson \(1991\). The three commitments of CST should be considered an over-simplification of the range of issues considered important by critical systems thinkers. However, they are useful for indicating the general interests pursued by proponents of the perspective. ****

Many different perspectives on CST are offered in the literature. What they all have in common, however, is an interest in questions about, and surrounding, the nature of the above commitments. ****There is no consensus on their definition. Indeed, different writers have evolved very different understandings, and continue to develop their ideas in communication with others. CST can therefore be seen as an evolving discourse around a set of themes that are considered important by a significant number of systems practitioners. The term 'discourse' is central here as it emphasizes dynamism and continued development rather than the stasis of a final definition.

The three commitments of CST are derived from the work over Habermas, who claimed that all human beings have three fundamental interests:

1. a 'technical interest' in predicting and controlling our natural and social environment.
2. a 'practical interest' in pursuing mutual understanding.
3.  an 'emancipatory interest' in freeing ourselves from constraints imposed by power relations.

Flood and Jackson suggest that

* "hard" cybernetic systems approaches support technical interest
* "soft" methodologies support practical interest
* critical systems heuristics support emancipatory interest
