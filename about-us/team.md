# Our Team

> #### Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It's about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others' success, and then standing back and letting them shine.

## Introduction

SPEC is run by a small and dedicated core team of part-time contributors and volunteers. We come from diverse backgrounds and have divergent perspectives. Many of us have families, full-time jobs, are going to school, making a career change, or experiencing another major life event, especially with the current pandemic and climate crisis.

SPEC's co-founders work on a 100% volunteer basis and openly donate funds to the collective. They have no financial stake in and do not receive compensation from the collective. SPEC is guided by its Steering Committee, which consists of a diverse network of experts across a multitude of disciplines and professions willing to volunteer their time and knowledge to SPEC's mission.

We are striving to make sustainable careers for our contributors. Currently, all of SPEC's researchers and contributors are classified as independent contractors for SPEC and by proxy the Open Collective Foundation \(OCF\). We are working with the OCF to be able to contributors to be classified as employees and be able to access benefits like health insurance. We won't be able to make the jobs a reality without funding. Please consider donating and helping to create more jobs for people working on making the world a better place! Learn more about donating to SPEC here.
