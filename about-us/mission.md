Our mission is to empower individuals to become globally-minded change agents by helping them learn the essential skills required to build sustainable careers and make a positive impact in their communities. We understand that for many people from underserved communities, they can't give back or help others until they are able to access essential goods and services, learn professional skills, and achieve physical and financial security. We create paid and unpaid opportunities for learners conducting research and participating in service-learning projects where they are able learn new skills while helping vulnerable populations and contributing to environmental and social justice initiatives. SPEC's model incorporates participatory action research to facilitate engagement and agency of the members of the communities affected by its research.
