# Open Design System

## Introduction

SPEC is exploring accelerating sustainability and social justice focused initiatives by developing an open source design system that provides primitives for building radically transparent, inclusive, and accessible products and services.

## Research

We are currently investigating the existing literature about design systems development. Below is a collection of resources related&#x20;

### The case for an open design system

The third of a three-part series that takes a deep dive through Workdayâ€™s experience of developing, productizing, and eventually releasing their design system out into the open.\[1]

### Stencil

A compiler that generates web components and builds high performance web apps. Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frameworks into a simple build-time tool.\[3]

## Project Plan

SPEC plans on developing the project open source with a focus on create opportunities for new developers, especially individuals from underrepresented groups and underserved communities. We will focus on making the design system lightweight, inclusive, and accessible.

## Next Steps

We are currently hiring research associates and contributors. Checkout our call for researchers to learn more about opportunities currently available at SPEC.&#x20;
