# Compensation Structure

SPEC's compensation structure is designed to establish fair, equitable, and transparent pay for all contributors in the collective. It gives the collective clear guidelines for assigning initial pay rates and managing raises and distributing bonuses. In order for SPEC's compensation structure to be considered effective, it must dismantle pay practices based on inequitable factors, like past salary history and ineffective negotiation, and on inherent biases like gender or race. \[1]

### Methodology

SPEC leverages a collaborative approach to developing its compensation structure. This Collaborative Compensation Structure (CCS) is based on SPEC's core values and operating principles.

1. **Sustainability Through Systems Thinking**
2. **Progress Through Open Collaboration**
3. **Equality Through Mutual Reciprocity**

The CCS embodies SPEC's core values through its application of the operating principles to the problem domain of creating a compensation structure. When developing the CCS, we bring to mind the following four sub-principles.

1. Strive for openness in our research, communications, organizational process, finances, and data.
2. Use critical awareness when building systems, rigorously examining assumptions and evaluating the conditions which give rise to them.
3. Seek solutions that usher in improvement locally and globally by creating balance between economy, equity, and environment.
4. Treat everyone in our communities with compassion, mutual respect, and accountability.
5. Cultivate collaborative environments that facilitate deliberative conversations, provide psychological safety, and enable full and equitable participation of individuals from all social identities, backgrounds, and perspectives.

### Core Principles

From SPEC's operating principles we derive the core principles of the CCS:

1. Make 100% of SPEC's finances transparent to our contributors and community, and general public.
2. Approach compensation with critical awareness, rigorously examining and challenging assumptions about pay structure, performance evaluation, and raises.
3. Strive to create balance between organizational success, financial and environmental sustainability, equity, and the welfare of our contributors and communities.
4. Foster mutual respect with our community members, hold each other with accountability, and fairly and compassionately compensate contributors.
5. Ensure full and equitable participation of individuals from all social identities, backgrounds, and perspectives in the discourse about SPEC's compensation structure and collaborative decision-making process.

### Contributor Levels

ðŸš§ The contributor levels below are a work in progress and are currently being developed collaboratively. ðŸš§

| Level              | Code | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Administrator**  | L3   | Supervisor responsible for managing the collective's overall operations, organizational development, strategic vision, and sustainability.                  |

### Pay Rates

SPEC's pay rates are determined through a collaborative process and careful evaluation of its current funding, capacity, and ongoing projects. These rates will be regularly revisited and adjusted to ensure fair and equitable compensation of contributors and long-term financial sustainability of SPEC. All decisions and changes related to the CCS will be published openly as part of SPEC's release notes.

| L3    | $0.00           |
