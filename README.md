# Introduction

The Sustainable Progress and Equality Collective (SPEC) is an open learning organization that helps individuals and communities become catalysts for positive change. SPEC's mission is to empower people to become globally-minded change agents by helping them learn the essential skills required to build sustainable careers and make a positive impact in their communities.&#x20;

We aim to uplift people from underrepresented backgrounds and communities by providing equitable opportunities through research, mentorship, training, work experience, service-learning, and events promoting professional growth, environmental sustainability, and social justice.

## Our Vision

SPEC takes inspiration from the work of the renowned 20th-century inventor and visionary Richard Buckminster Fuller. Fuller dedicated his life to creating systems and technologies that would enable people to live healthy and productive lives. His contention was that only a systems approach that takes the whole world into account can address the complex problems facing humanity.&#x20;

#### &#x20;Fuller envisioned the world game as a place where individuals or teams of people cooperated to:

> #### make the world work for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation without ecological offense or disadvantage of anyone.

At SPEC, we believe that the technologies needed to realize Fuller's vision exist today. Modern computers enable distributed collaboration, information processing, and data analysis capabilities that Fuller only could have dreamed of. We can use these technologies to build sustainable systems of living and working. However, advanced technologies alone won't make Fuller's vision for the world a reality.

We will need to adopt a radically transparent and equitable approach to building organizations and communities. SPEC fosters participation and action by members of the communities affected by its work. By working alongside underserved communities and uplifting unheard voices, SPEC's collective intelligence and collaborative network will continue to grow. Only then will we be able to collaboratively innovate to create solutions that truly make the world work for all people and the planet.

## Core Values

SPEC's founders established the collective based on the core values of **sustainability, progress,** and **equality**. These values provide a recipe for building organizations that are radically transparent, sustainable, and equitable. The world is constantly changing and SPEC will continuously evolve to adapt, incorporating the voices and collective knowledge of its members.

How we interpret and formalize our core values and operating principles will need to be regularly revisited and updated to reflect the organization's goals, user feedback, and community contributions. To learn more about SPEC's Core Values, click the link below.

## Our Team

SPEC is run by a small and dedicated team of contributors and volunteers. We come from different social identities, backgrounds, and perspectives. SPEC's co-founders and steering committee work entirely on a volunteer basis, have no financial stake in the collective, and do not receive compensation in any form.

## Our Collective

SPEC is organized as an open collective, a collaborative group that has a shared mission, which raises and spends funds transparently to achieve goals. SPEC is hosted on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/), an online funding platform that provides groups with the tools for raising and sharing their finances in full transparency. The platform makes all contributions and expenses visible to the public. SPEC's budget and expenses can be found on its [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/spec).

SPEC is fiscally sponsored by the [Open Collective Foundation 501(c)(3)](https://opencollective.foundation/) (OCF), which allows it to operate without legally incorporating, and accept tax deductible donations, and pay contributors. OCF's mission is to empower impact-focused groups working on increasing access to educational resources and training, creating a positive social impact, and fostering civic participation within cities and communities.

OCF is creating a legal, financial, and technical commons for a solidarity economy, economic activities that prioritize social profitability instead of purely financial profits. A distinguishing characteristic of solidarity economy entities is the participatory and democratic nature of their governance in decision-making processes. Active participation of all people involved in decision-making contributes to community empowerment.
