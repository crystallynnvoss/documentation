# Guide to Code Bootcamps

## Introduction

Coding bootcamps are accelerated learning programs that teach digital skills like software engineering, data science, product management, and UX/UI Design. Compared to traditional computer science and software engineering programs offered by 4 year colleges and universities, coding bootcamps are significantly shorter in duration. Typically, coding bootcamps aim to prepare students to be job-ready for a career in tech in about 12 to 16 weeks. Today, there are more than 100 coding bootcamps in cities across the US and Canada, and ~50 bootcamps internationally.\[1\]

## Knowledge & Training

Coding bootcamps teach modern, widely used programming languages and frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Python on Django, JavaScript, CSS, and ReactJS. Many bootcamps are heavily project-based, and require students to immediately put their learnings into practice. Students build fully functional web-apps, do data analysis and use real dev tools just weeks into their programs. In recent years, the bootcamp model has extended to other digital skills like UX/UI Design, Data Science, and Cybersecurity. Bootcamp graduates leave these programs with a portfolio, an online presence, interview skills and more. \[1\]

## Job Outlook

Software engineering is one of the fastest growing professions today. The roles and responsibilities range from industry and technology stack. The BLS estimates from 2014 to 2024 that the number of software engineers will increase by 17%. Most bootcamps help graduates find an internship or match students with an employer network. According Course Report's most recent research, 79% of bootcamp alumni report being employed in programming jobs. 

According to Indeed.com, the average salary for a software engineer in the United States is $111,537. A good starting software engineer salary in the US is considered to be $113,211 per year. Competitive starting salaries will vary depending on location and cost of living.

## Cost

The average bootcamp costs ~$14,000, and graduates report an average starting salary of $69,000. Since the first bootcamps opened their doors in February 2012, this industry has grown throughout the US and around the world. Bootcamps can vary in length from 6 to 28 weeks, although the average bootcamp is ~14 weeks long. Many bootcamps offer financing and repayment plans, where graduates do not start paying back their bootcamp until they have landed a job.
