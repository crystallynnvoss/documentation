# Project Management

Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve a set of goals within the given constraints. This information is usually described in documentation that is created at the beginning of the development process. Project documentation is updated continuously throughout a project's life cycle as changes are requested. The primary constraints are scope, time, and budget. The secondary challenge of project management is optimization of the allocation of required inputs and the application of them to meet pre-defined objectives. \[1]

## Why Learn Project Management?

The importance of project management in organizations canâ€™t be overstated. When itâ€™s done right, it helps every part of the organization run more smoothly. It allows your team to focus on the work that matters, free from the distractions caused by tasks going off track or budgets growing out of control. Project management empowers teams to deliver results that actually impact the organization's development, growth, and success. And it enables employees to see how their work contributes to the organizations strategic goals.\[2]
