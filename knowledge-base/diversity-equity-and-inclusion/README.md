# Diversity Equity & Inclusion

## Introduction

According to the National Cooperative Extension program Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion are defined as follows:

**Diversity** is the presence of differences that may include race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, language, \(dis\)ability, age, religious commitment, or political perspective.  Populations that have been-and remain- underrepresented among practitioners in the field and marginalized in the broader society.

**Equity** is promoting justice, impartiality and fairness within the procedures, processes, and distribution of resources by institutions or systems.  Tackling equity issues requires an understanding of the root causes of outcome disparities within our society.

**Inclusion** is an outcome to ensure those that are diverse actually feel and/or are welcomed.  Inclusion outcomes are met when you, your institution, and your program are truly inviting to all.  To the degree to which diverse individuals are able to participate fully in the decision-making processes and development opportunities within an organization or group.

At SPEC, we are committed to applying the principles of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion \(DEI\) both in our workplace and in our work. We believe in building inclusive environments where anyone is and feels welcomed, respected, supported, valued, and able to fully participate. SPEC promotes an inclusive and welcoming culture. We embrace our differences and offer respect and compassion for all people. We hope our work environment fosters a diversity of thought, ideas, perspectives, and values.

This Knowledge Base entry is designed to provide useful information and resources for individuals interested in support research or activism in the area of DEI and social justice.

### Equality Equity, and Reciprocity: The Three Pillars of Social Justice

In his 2011 book, _The Fair Society: The Science of Human Nature and the Pursuit of Social Justice_, Peter Corning proposed a vision of social justice based on three biologically-grounded fairness principles. Corning believes that these principles must be combined and balanced in order to achieve a society that is fair to everyone. According to Corning, the three fairness principles are equality, equity, and reciprocity.  They are derived from the emerging, multi-disciplinary science of human nature and the mounting evidence that a sense of fairness is an evolved and distinctively human behavioral trait.\[1\]
