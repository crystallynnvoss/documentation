## Equality Equity, and Reciprocity: The Three Pillars of Social Justice

In his 2011 book, _The Fair Society: The Science of Human Nature and the Pursuit of Social Justice_, Peter Corning proposed a vision of social justice based on three biologically-grounded fairness principles. Corning believes that these principles must be combined and balanced in order to achieve a society that is fair to everyone. According to Corning, the three fairness principles are equality, equity, and reciprocity.  They are derived from the emerging, multi-disciplinary science of human nature and the mounting evidence that a sense of fairness is an evolved and distinctively human behavioral trait.\[1\]
