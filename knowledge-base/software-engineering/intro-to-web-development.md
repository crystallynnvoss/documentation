# Intro to Web Development

## Introduction

Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet \(World Wide Web\) or an intranet \(a private network\). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

## Why Learn Web Development?

The Web is one of the fastest-growing communication and technology platforms. In just 25 years, over 5082 million users have started using the internet. Since the commercialization of the Web, Web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry has been driven by businesses aiming to use their websites to advertise and sell products and services to customers.

With advancements in programming languages, web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari have started to support several features which were previously available only to native application developers. In the past, a significant disadvantage of web development was the unavailability of operating specific features, for example â€” being able to access a webpage directly from the home screen, work offline or send push notifications. 

### 1. Job Growth

In 2020, there was approximately 1.4 million computing jobs available, which there was only approximately 400,000 qualified developers to fill them. Those interested in acquiring in-demand skills can certainly benefit from having Web development and coding in their resume. It is safe to say there is, and will continue to be, high demand for web developers. You won't have to worry about finding jobs for web developers any time soon.

### 2. Salary

According to U.S. News & World Report, Web developers made a median salary of $73,760 in 2019, with the best-paid 25% making $102,900 that year, while the lowest-paid 25 percent made $53,520. Salary shouldn't be the only factor when deciding whether or not to learn web development, but it should be taken into consideration. With the average household income in the United States being $75,235 in 2021, average income for web developers looks pretty nice.

### 3. Flexible Learning Pathways

There are several pathways for becoming a web developer. You can enroll in a computer science degree, teach yourself online, or do a code bootcamp. All are great options and offer differing pros and cons including cost, difficulty, and time commitment. Which path you choose depends on how quickly you want to get out into the workforce. A major benefit of teaching yourself or enrolling in a bootcamp is that you can know how to code, and code well, in 12 - 16 weeks. Either path will be an intense period of learning, but you if you're serious about learning how to code, you can accelerate your career through deliberate practice and study. Teaching yourself to code requires a significant degree of discipling and an ability holding yourself accountable for your learning and job search. With a bootcamp you will have people dedicated to your success in learning and finding a job throughout your bootcamp experience. If you commit to learning the material, daily practice, and building projects, before you know it, you'll find a job as a Web developer!

### 4. Remote work opportunities

All you need for web development is the internet and a laptop! While not all web development jobs are remote, the technology industry is increasingly offering remote opportunities and flexible schedules for web developers and other digital focused professions.

## Core Concepts

### Web Browser

A web browser \(commonly referred to as a browser\) is application software for accessing the World Wide Web. When a user follows the URL of a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from the website's web server and then displays the page on the user's device.

A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.

Web browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people used a browser. The most used browser is Google Chrome, with a 64% global market share on all devices, followed by Safari with 19%.

### Web Server

A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests from a web browser and responds with the content of that resource or an error message. The server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.

### HTML

The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

### CSS

Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
