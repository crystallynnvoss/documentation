# Software Engineering

## Introduction

There are many definitions and understandings of Software Engineering. Software engineering can be understood as a formal sub-discipline of computer science, electrical engineering, and computer engineering. It is also seen as a profession, career, vocation, and craft. The ISO/IEC/IEEE Systems and Software Engineering Vocabulary \(SEVOCAB\) define software engineering as "the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software\)." Software engineers apply the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software. The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of formal education or skills. Software engineering is critical to modern technologies from your alarm clock to rocket flight control systems. Modern society truly runs on computer software. 

## What is Computer Software?

Computer software \(or simply software\) is a set of instructions and that tells a computer how to work. Computer hardware \(or simply hardware\) is a physical system that performs the work defined by software. Computer software and hardware require each other and neither can be used on their own. Software encompasses all information processed by a computer system, including programs, libraries, and non-executable data such as documentation or media.

## History of Software Engineering

Software engineering emerged as a sub-discipline of computer science, electrical engineering, and computer engineering in the beginning of the 1960s. Software engineering was developed in part as a response to the Software Crisis, which was a perceived period in the early days of computer science known for the difficulty successfully developing and delivering software projects. During this period of time, a high percentage of software projects had failed due to a variety of reasons including

* Projects running over-budget
* Projects running over-time
* Software was very inefficient
* Software was of low quality
* Software often did not meet requirements
* Projects were unmanageable and code difficult to maintain
*  Software was never delivered

A major cause of the Software Crisis was determined to be that computers were becoming several orders of magnitude more powerful at an exponential rate. As Edsger Dijkstra, the creator of the C++ programming language, put it bluntly "as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem." Rapid increases in computer power caused an explosion of complexity in the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate.

## Establishment of a Discipline

During the Software Crisis,  term "software engineering" emerged, with its origins attributed to various sources. The term appeared in a list of services offered by companies in the June 1965 issue of COMPUTERS and AUTOMATION. The ACM President Anthony A. Oettinger. It used it more formally in the August 1966 issue of Communications of the ACM. It is associated with the title of a NATO conference in 1968 by Professor Friedrich L. Bauer, the first conference on software engineering.

Margaret Hamilton also is credited as independently naming the discipline "software engineering" during the Apollo missions to provide legitimacy to the work her team was doing. The term "engineering" was used to acknowledge that the work should be taken just as seriously as other contributions toward the advancement of technology.

In 1984, the Software Engineering Institute \(SEI\) was established as a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Watts Humphrey founded the SEI Software Process Program, aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering process. The Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development\(CMMI-DEV\) currently used by US Government to evaluate the abilities of a software development team, was developed through Humphrey's program.

Today, the [ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 subcommittee](https://www.iso.org/committee/45086.html) has collected modern, general accepted best-practices for software engineering which are published as the [Software Engineering Body of Knowledge](https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering) \(SWEBOK\).

## Profession

Software engineering is one of the fastest growing professions today. The roles and responsibilities range from industry and technology stack. In 2018, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\(BLS\) counted 1,365,500 software developers holding jobs in the U.S. Since software engineering is relatively new discipline, formal education is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum. As such, software engineers typically hold computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering degrees. The BLS estimates from 2014 to 2024 that the number of software engineers will increase by 17%.

## Education

Software engineers work on a variety of technologies from websites to flight control systems, require varying education and training in computer science, computer programming, engineering, mathematics, and project management. Open Source Society University offers a free online curriculum that corresponds to 4-year degree in computer science with links to online education resources and courses. It covers a variety of subjects including computer science theory, computer programming, mathematics, engineering tools, operating systems, data structures & algorithms, information security, software engineering, and advanced computer science topics.

## ABET Accreditation

The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology \(ABET\) is a non-governmental organization that accredits post-secondary education programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology. According to the ABET, in addition to the general criteria for all baccalaureate level engineering programs, a college's software engineering program must meeting the following criteria to qualify for accreditation:

* Provide both breadth and depth across the range of engineering and computer science topics implied by the title and objectives of the program
* Include computing fundamentals, software design and construction, requirements analysis, security, verification, and validation
* Teach software engineering processes and tools appropriate for the development of complex software systems
* Cover discrete mathematics, probability, and statistics, with applications appropriate to software engineering

The program's faculty members must also teach core software engineering topics, have an understanding of professional practice in software engineering, and maintain currency in their areas of professional or scholarly specialization.

## Code Bootcamps

The demand for software engineers, especially in the areas of web and mobile application development, has been exploded in recent years. Code bootcamps have emerged to fill the demand to training in software engineering. Bootcamps offer accelerated learning programs that teach digital skills like software engineering, data science, product management, and UX/UI Design. Learn more about code bootcamps on SPEC's Guide to Code Bootcamps.
