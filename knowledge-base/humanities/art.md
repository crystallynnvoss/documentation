# Art

Art encompasses a wide range of human activities and artifacts that require creative imagination and express technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas. What has deemed to constitutes art has changed over time and there is no generally agreed definition of the subject. The three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of "the arts". \[1]
