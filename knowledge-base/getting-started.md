# Getting Started

SPEC's Knowledge Base (KB) is designed to help its community members learn new skills and advance their educations and careers. To make this knowledge base accessible to as many people as possible we have strived to primarily list free and open education resources (OER). The KB does also provide information about lower cost educational programs that can be used for supplementary learning.

⚠️ KB is work in progress and is actively under construction. You may find incomplete sections as we are in the process of filling out the KB.
