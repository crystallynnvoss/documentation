# Plant Growth Factors

This guide has been adapted from Oregon State University's guide to [Environmental Factors Affecting Plant Growth](https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/techniques/environmental-factors-affecting-plant-growth).

## Introduction

Each type of plant has a unique set of characteristics and require different things \(water, sunlight, soil type, etc.\). Some plants like it hot and sunny, while others like it cooler or moister \(or both\). Plant growth and geographic distribution are greatly affected by environment factors. If any environmental factor is less than ideal, it limits a plant's growth and/or distribution.

Either directly or indirectly, most plant problems are caused by environmental stress. In some cases, poor environmental conditions \(e.g., too little water\) damage a plant directly. In other cases, environmental stress weakens a plant and makes it more susceptible to disease or insect attack.

Environmental factors that affect plant growth include light, temperature, water, humidity, and nutrition. It is important to understand how these factors affect plant growth and development. With a basic understanding of these factors, you may be able to manipulate plants to meet your needs, whether for increased leaf, flower, or fruit production. By recognizing the roles of these factors, you also will be better able to diagnose plant problems caused by environmental stress.

### Light

Plants harness energy from the sun and, through photosynthesis, convert that energy into building tissue. Because plants need the sun to grow, many of them, including most fruits and veggies, need a good amount of direct sun during the day. Research has shown some plants prefer shady conditions if you have less light available. Three principal characteristics of light affect plant growth: quantity, quality, and duration.

* Light quantity refers to the intensity, or concentration, of sunlight. It varies with the seasons. 
* Light quality refers to the color \(wavelength\) of light.
* Duration, or photoperiod, refers to the amount of time a plant is exposed to light.

### Water

Most growing plants contain about 90% water. Water plays many roles in plants including:

* A primary component in photosynthesis and respiration
* Responsible for turgor pressure in cells which affects fullness and firmness of plant tissue. Turgor is needed to maintain cell shape and ensure cell growth.
* A solvent for minerals and carbohydrates moving through the plant
* Responsible for cooling leaves as it evaporates from leaf tissue during transpiration
* A regulator of stomatal opening and closing, thus controlling transpiration and, to some degree, photosynthesis
* The source of pressure to move roots through the soil
* The medium in which most biochemical reactions take place

### Humidity

Relative humidity \(RH\) is the ratio of water vapor in the air to the amount of water the air could hold at the current temperature and pressure. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air. RH is expressed by the following equation:

$$
RH = water\:in\:air ÷ water\:air\:can\:hold
$$

RH is given as a percent. For example, if a pound of air at 75°F could hold 4 grams of water vapor, and there are only 3 grams of water in the air, then the relative humidity \(at constant temperature and pressure\) is:

$$
3 ÷ 4 = 0.75 = 75\%
$$

Water vapor moves from an area of high relative humidity to one of low relative humidity. The greater the difference in humidity, the faster water moves. This factor is important because the rate of water movement directly affects a plant's transpiration rate.

The relative humidity in the air spaces between leaf cells approaches 100 percent. When a stoma opens, water vapor inside the leaf rushes out into the surrounding air, and a bubble of high humidity forms around the stoma. By saturating this small area of air, the bubble reduces the difference in relative humidity between the air spaces within the leaf and the air adjacent to the leaf. As a result, transpiration slows down.

If wind blows the humidity bubble away, however, transpiration increases. Thus, transpiration usually is at its peak on hot, dry, windy days. On the other hand, transpiration generally is quite slow when temperatures are cool, humidity is high, and there is no wind.

Hot, dry conditions generally occur during the summer, which partially explains why plants wilt quickly in the summer. If a constant supply of water is not available to be absorbed by the roots and moved to the leaves, turgor pressure is lost and leaves go limp.

### Nutrients

Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements and compounds necessary for plant growth, plant metabolism and their external supply. Plant nutrition often is confused with fertilization. Plant nutrition refers to a plant's need for and use of basic chemical elements. Fertilization is the term used when these materials are added to the environment around a plant. A lot must happen before a chemical element in a fertilizer can be used by a plant. In its absence the plant is unable to complete a normal life cycle, or that the element is part of some essential plant constituent or metabolite. 

Plants need 17 elements for normal growth. Three of them--carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen--are found in air and water. The rest are found in the soil. Six soil elements are called macronutrients because they are used in relatively large amounts by plants. They are nitrogen, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and sulfur. Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are absorbed from the air, whereas other nutrients including nitrogen are typically obtained from the soil \(exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants\). Plants must obtain the following mineral nutrients from their growing medium:

#### Macronutrients

* nitrogen \(N\)
* phosphorus \(P\)
* potassium \(K\)
* calcium \(Ca\)
* sulfur \(S\)
* magnesium \(Mg\)
* carbon \(C\)
* oxygen \(O\)
* hydrogen \(H\)

#### Micronutrients \(or trace minerals\)

* iron \(Fe\)
* boron \(B\)
* chlorine \(Cl\)
* manganese \(Mn\)
* zinc \(Zn\)
* copper \(Cu\)
* molybdenum \(Mo\)
* nickel \(Ni\)

### Temperature

Temperature plays an important role in plant growth. Plants will slow down or speed up their growth rate based on the temperature. Warm temperatures encourage growth and germination. A warmer temperature will actually trigger a chemical reaction inside the cells of a plant and this will speed up respiration, transpiration, and the photosynthesis process.\[4\] Plant growth is faster during warmer periods and will slow down or become dormant in a cooler period.

When combined with day-length, temperature also affects the change from vegetative \(leafy\) to reproductive \(flowering\) growth. Depending on the situation and the specific plant, the effect of temperature can either speed up or slow down this transition.

## Hardiness

Plants are classified as hardy or nonhardy depending on their ability to withstand cold temperatures. Hardy plants are those that are adapted to the cold temperatures of their growing environment.

Winter injury to plants generally occurs when temperatures drop too quickly in the fall before a plant has progressed to full dormancy. In other cases, a plant may break dormancy in mid or late winter if the weather is unseasonably warm. If a sudden, severe cold snap follows the warm spell, otherwise hardy plants can be seriously damaged. The tops of hardy plants are much more cold-tolerant than the roots. Plants that normally are hardy to 10°F may be killed if they are in containers and the roots are exposed to 20°F.

Cold temperates may also cause desiccation \(drying out\) of plant tissues. When the soil is frozen, water movement into a plant may become severely restricted. On a windy winter day, broadleaf evergreens can become water-deficient in a few minutes, and the leaves or needles then turn brown. To minimize the risk of this type of injury, make sure your plants go into the winter well watered.
