# Hydroponics

## Introduction

Hydroponics is a type of horticulture which involves growing plants \(usually crops\) without soil, by using mineral nutrient solutions in an aqueous solvent. Terrestrial plants may grow with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid, or, in addition, the roots may be physically supported by an inert medium such as perlite, gravel, or other substrates. Despite inert media, roots can cause changes of the rhizosphere pH and root exudates can affect rhizosphere biology. Plants commonly grown hydroponically, on inert media, include tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, strawberries, lettuces, cannabis, and model plants like Arabidopsis thaliana.

## Advantages of Hydroponics

Hydroponics offers many advantages, notably a decrease in water usage in agriculture. To grow 1 kilogram \(2.2 lb\) of tomatoes using intensive farming methods requires 400 liters \(88 imp gal; 110 U.S. gal\) of water; using hydroponics, 70 liters \(15 imp gal; 18 U.S. gal\); and only 20 liters \(4.4 imp gal; 5.3 U.S. gal\) using aeroponics.\[8\] Since hydroponics takes much less water to grow produce, it could be possible in the future for people in harsh environments with little accessible water to grow their own food.

## Irrigation Methods

There are two main variations for each medium: sub-irrigation and top irrigation. For all irrigation methods, most hydroponic reservoirs are now built of plastic, but other materials have been used including concrete, glass, metal, vegetable solids, and wood. The containers must light to prevent algae and fungal growth in the nutrient solution.

### Passive Hydroponics

Passive hydroponics systems are the some of the simplest growing methods. An inert porous growing medium is used to transport water and fertilizer to the roots by capillary action. Water and fertilizer are held in a reservoir and conducted to the roots as necessary, reducing labor and providing a constant supply of water to the roots. In the simplest method, the pot sits in a shallow solution of fertilizer and water or on a capillary mat saturated with nutrient solution. Since routine maintenance is much simplified, passive hydroponics can reduce the labor required to maintain a large collection of plants.

### Kratky Method

The Kratky method is a passive hydroponic technique for growing plants suspended above a reservoir of nutrient-rich water. Because it is a non-circulating technique, no additional inputs of water or nutrients are needed after the original application, and no electricity, pumps, or water and oxygen circulation systems are required. The Kratky method has applications both for commercial food production and as a small-scale and low-maintenance technique for home growers.It has been described as "the simplest hydroponic system."
