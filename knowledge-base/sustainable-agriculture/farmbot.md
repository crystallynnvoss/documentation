# Farmbot

## Introduction

SPEC is researching the application of the Farmbot open source CNC farming machine in urban and rural environments. Farmbot enables automation of the agricultural tasks including sowing, watering, weeding, and monitoring soil and pests. SPEC is exploring teaching STEAM using Farmbot and other controlled environment agriculture technologies like Modular Greenhouses and open source environmental technologies like [Juniper Garden](https://docs.specollective.org/projects/sustainability-accelerator/juniper-garden).

## Technology

A farmbot unit consists of a modular tool head mounted onto a frame that enables motion across the Cartesian coordinate system. The tool head is designed to enable automatic mounting of tools including a seeder, soil sensor, and weeder.  Farmbot is controlled by a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.appropedia.org/Raspberry_Pi) microcomputer running the Farmbot operating system and a Farmduino microcontroller. Farmbot is programmable through a web interface that enables remote access. Weeding tasks are aided by a built-in computer vision system.
