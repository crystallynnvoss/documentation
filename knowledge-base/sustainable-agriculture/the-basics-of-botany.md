# The Basics of Botany

## What is a plant?

Plants are a major group of living organisms that includes trees, flowers, herbs, ferns, and mosses. About 350,000 species of plants, defined as seed plants, bryophytes, ferns and fern allies, have been estimated to exist. As of 2004, some 287,655 species had been identified, of which 258,650 are flowering and 15,000 bryophytes. Plants are mostly autotrophs, organisms that obtain energy from sunlight or organisms that make their own food. Most plants carry out a process called photosynthesis, which enables plants to use the energy in sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into simple sugars. These sugars are then used as building blocks and form the main structural component of the plant. Plants rely on soil primarily for water \(in quantitative terms\), but also obtain nitrogen, phosphorus and other crucial elemental nutrients. Most of the solid material in a plant is taken is actually taken from the atmosphere. For the majority of plants to grow successfully they also require oxygen in the atmosphere \(for respiration in the dark\) and oxygen around their roots.\[1\]

## Defining Characteristics

* **Seeds**:
  * Young plants that continue the lifecycle
* **Roots**: 
  * Handle absorption of water and minerals
  * Anchor plant to the soil
  * Usually found underground
* **Stems**: 
  * support of leaves, flowers, and fruits
  * transportation of water - minerals from roots to leaves
  * found above and below ground.
* **Leaves**: 
  * Site of photosynthesis or food-making
  * Usually found above ground
* **Flowers**:
  *  Attract animals and provide nectar while completing the needed process of pollination
* **Fruits**
  * Protect and disperse the seeds inside

## Plant Anatomy

The plant body can be divided into three main parts: roots, stems, and leaves. Some botanists refer to the latter two as ‚Äúshoots‚Äù. Usually they are easy to differentiate the two by what they look like, but the distinction between them can sometimes be fuzzy. For example, some plants have stems that resemble roots \(e.g. ginger\), or stems that resemble leaves \(e.g. prickly pear cactus\). It is important to understand that plants need certain materials to survive. They essential materials may be obtained by roots in some plants but through the stems or leaves in another. The determination of whether a plant part is a root or stem, such as the potato, seems to be less important.
