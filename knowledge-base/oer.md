# Open Education Resources

## Introduction

Open Educational Resources \(OER\) are teaching, learning and research materials that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions. OER form part of 'Open Solutions', alongside Free and Open Source software \(FOSS\), Open Access \(OA\), Open Data \(OD\) and crowdsourcing platforms. The term OER describes publicly accessible materials and resources for any user to use, re-mix, improve, and redistribute under some licenses. The development and promotion of open educational resources is often motivated by a desire to provide an alternate or enhanced education paradigm.\[1\]
